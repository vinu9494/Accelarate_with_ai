## Overview

Traditional data engineering requires a data engineer to manually inspect raw files, write transformation rules, apply cleansing logic, build aggregation queries, and produce reports. This pipeline automates that entire workflow using autonomous AI agents.

**What you do:**
1. Upload raw CSV files via the Streamlit UI
2. Type a business question (e.g. *"Which product category had the highest sales in Q4?"*)
3. Review and approve AI-generated transformation rules at three checkpoints
4. Receive a complete HTML executive report with SQL-backed charts

**What the agents do:**
- Profile your data and understand its structure
- Generate Source-to-Target Mapping (STTM) rules for each pipeline layer
- Execute Bronze ingestion, Silver cleansing, and Gold materialisation
- Write and run SQL to answer your business question
- Produce an interactive HTML report with Plotly charts

### The Four Phases

| Phase | Agents | Output | Gate |
|-------|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Profiler → STTM | `profile.json` + `sttm_bronze.csv` | ⏸ Human approves Bronze STTM |
| **Phase 2** | Bronze → STTM | `*_bronze.parquet` + `sttm_silver.csv` | ⏸ Human approves Silver STTM |
| **Phase 3** | Silver → STTM | `*_silver.parquet` + `sttm_gold.csv` | ⏸ Human approves Gold STTM |
| **Phase 4** | Gold → Reporter | `*.parquet` (Gold tables) + `report.html` | ✅ Pipeline complete |

## How It Works

### Medallion Layers

```
Raw CSV  ──▶  Bronze  ──▶  Silver  ──▶  Gold  ──▶  Report
             (ingest)    (cleanse)  (aggregate)   (answer)
```

| Layer | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bronze** | CSV → Parquet. Columns renamed, types cast, `_load_timestamp` and `_source_file` metadata injected. No null handling — faithful raw copy. |
| **Silver** | Bronze Parquet → cleansed Parquet. Nulls handled (drop/fill), deduplication, type standardisation, date formatting (→ YYYY-MM-DD), surrogate key `pk_*_silver_id` injected as first column. |
| **Gold** | Silver Parquet → analytics-ready Parquet. Multi-source joins, aggregations (sum/avg/count/max/min), `pk_gold_id` surrogate key. One file per Gold target table. |
| **Report** | Gold Parquet → HTML. DuckDB runs SQL, Plotly renders charts, structured executive summary answers the business question. |

### What Makes This Agentic

Every specialist agent follows the same autonomous pattern:

```
THINK → INSPECT → PLAN → ACT → VERIFY
```

1. **THINK** — reads the goal from the Supervisor and understands the context
2. **INSPECT** — calls its inspect tool to preview inputs before touching any data
3. **PLAN** — states an explicit plan based on what it observed
4. **ACT** — calls its execution tool to process data
5. **VERIFY** — confirms outputs and reports back to the Supervisor

The LLM decides **when** to call tools. Python executes the actual data work. This separation gives you AI intelligence with deterministic, reliable data processing.

## Agents

### Supervisor Orchestrator — `orchestrator.py`

The pipeline coordinator. Not a simple script — an autonomous LLM agent that receives a phase goal, plans which specialist agents to call, dispatches them with rich goal descriptions, and verifies outputs.

**Entry points (called by Streamlit UI):**
```python
run_until_bronze_sttm(uploaded_files, business_intent) -> PipelineState
run_bronze_to_silver_sttm(state) -> PipelineState
run_silver_to_gold_sttm(state) -> PipelineState
run_gold_and_report(state) -> PipelineState
```

**Key patterns used:** PipelineState (TypedDict), tool factories with closures, scratchpad dict for intra-phase handoffs.

---

### Profiler Agent — `profiler.py`

Profiles raw CSV files to understand structure, semantics, and quality.

**Tools:**
- `inspect_files_tool` — lightweight preview (shape, column names, dtypes, 3 sample values)
- `profiler_tool` — full statistics (null count/%, unique count, min/max/mean)

**Returns:** Path to `data/profiles/profile_combined_*.json`

**Output contains:** Raw statistics per column, semantic meanings, discovered join keys, data quality notes.

---

### STTM Agent — `sttm_generator.py`

Unified agent that generates Source-to-Target Mapping rules for all three layers. The orchestrator tells it which layer to generate — the agent inspects context and picks the right tool.

**Tools:**
- `inspect_context_tool` — previews source data for the requested layer
- `generate_bronze_sttm_tool` — ingestion rules (rename, type cast, metadata)
- `generate_silver_sttm_tool` — cleansing rules (nulls, dedup, types, surrogate key)
- `generate_gold_sttm_tool` — materialisation rules (joins, aggregations, surrogate key)

**Entry points:**
```python
generate_bronze_sttm(profile_path, business_intent, run_id, task_description) -> str
generate_silver_sttm(bronze_output_paths, bronze_sttm_path, business_intent, run_id, task_description) -> str
generate_gold_sttm(silver_output_paths, silver_sttm_path, business_intent, run_id, task_description) -> str
```

**STTM CSV columns:** `source_schema`, `source_table`, `source_column`, `target_schema`, `target_table`, `target_column`, `transformation_type`, `transformation_logic`

---

### Bronze Agent — `bronze_agent.py`

Ingests raw CSV files into the Bronze Parquet layer using approved STTM rules.

**Tools:**
- `inspect_task_tool` — previews CSV file shapes and STTM transformation rules
- `bronze_ingestion_tool` — applies rules and writes Parquet files

**Entry point:**
```python
execute_bronze(input_files, sttm_path, run_id, task_description) -> list[str]
```

**What it does:** Column renaming, type casting (`to_numeric`, `to_datetime`), injects `_load_timestamp` (UTC ISO string) and `_source_file` (source path) into every output file.

---

### Silver Agent — `silver_agent.py`

Cleanses Bronze Parquet files into trusted Silver Parquet files.

**Tools:**
- `inspect_task_tool` — previews Bronze Parquet schemas, null counts, and STTM cleansing rules
- `silver_ingestion_tool` — applies cleansing and writes Silver Parquet files

**Entry point:**
```python
execute_silver(input_files, sttm_path, run_id, task_description) -> list[str]
```

**What it does:** Null handling (`dropna`, `fillna` with mean/median/mode/constant), deduplication (`drop_duplicates`), type casting, date standardisation (→ YYYY-MM-DD), text normalisation (strip/lower/upper), surrogate key injection (`pk_*_silver_id` as first column), column filtering to STTM-approved columns only.

---

### Gold Agent — `gold_agent.py`

Materialises analytics-ready Gold Parquet tables from Silver inputs.

**Tools:**
- `inspect_task_tool` — previews Silver schemas and STTM rules grouped by Gold target table
- `gold_ingestion_tool` — applies joins, aggregations, and writes Gold Parquet files

**Entry point:**
```python
execute_gold(input_files, sttm_path, business_intent, run_id, task_description) -> list[str]
```

**What it does:** Multi-source joins (outer join on matching `_id` columns), column renaming, `groupby().agg()` for sum/avg/count/max/min aggregations, surrogate key injection (`pk_gold_id` as first column). Produces one Parquet file per Gold target table defined in the STTM.

---

### Reporter Agent — `reporter.py`

Answers the business question by querying Gold tables with SQL and producing an HTML executive report.

**Tools:**
- `inspect_gold_tables_tool` — previews Gold table schemas and sample rows (no DuckDB)
- `load_gold_data_tool` — registers Gold Parquet files as DuckDB in-memory tables
- `execute_query_tool(sql_query)` — runs agent-written SQL, returns JSON rows

**Entry point:**
```python
generate_report(gold_files, business_intent, run_id, task_description) -> str
```

**What it produces:**
- `data/reports/report_{run_id[:8]}.html` — self-contained HTML with embedded Plotly charts
- `data/reports/report_{run_id[:8]}.json` — structured analysis (direct_answer, charts spec, detailed_analysis)

---

## Key Design Patterns

### Tool Factory + Closure

Every agent uses a factory function that captures runtime parameters (file paths, run IDs) via Python closure. This means the LLM never needs to reproduce exact file paths as arguments — eliminating hallucination risk.

```python
def _make_bronze_tools(input_files, sttm_path, run_id):
    # input_files, sttm_path, run_id are "closed over" below

    @tool
    def bronze_ingestion_tool(confirmation: str = "execute") -> str:
        """Execute Bronze ingestion."""
        # input_files and sttm_path come from the closure above
        # The LLM calls this with no file path arguments
        output_paths = _apply_bronze_rules(input_files, sttm_path, run_id)
        return json.dumps(output_paths)

    return bronze_ingestion_tool
```

### Scratchpad Pattern

Within a phase, tools share data via a plain Python dictionary (scratchpad) captured by closure. Tool 1 writes the output path, Tool 2 reads it — no LLM copy-pasting required.

```python
scratchpad = {}   # plain dict — no library needed

@tool
def profiler_agent_tool(goal: str) -> str:
    profile_path = profile_multiple_datasets(...)
    scratchpad["profile_path"] = profile_path   # Tool 1 writes
    return json.dumps({"profile_path": profile_path})

@tool
def sttm_agent_tool(goal: str) -> str:
    sttm_path = generate_bronze_sttm(
        profile_path=scratchpad["profile_path"],  # Tool 2 reads
        ...
    )
```

### Human-in-the-Loop Gates

Three approval gates pause the pipeline after each STTM generation. The STTM is the transformation recipe — if it is wrong, all downstream data is wrong. Human review before execution prevents errors from propagating silently.

```
Phase 1 runs → Human approves Bronze STTM → Phase 2 runs
Phase 2 runs → Human approves Silver STTM → Phase 3 runs
Phase 3 runs → Human approves Gold STTM   → Phase 4 runs
```

### ReAct Agent Loop

Every agent follows Think → Inspect → Plan → Act → Verify. The inspect tool runs first (lightweight, no side effects), the agent forms a plan, then the execution tool runs. The LLM never executes blindly.

### Separation of Intelligence and Execution

The LLM decides **when** to call tools and **what goal to pursue**. Python tools do the actual data work (pandas, DuckDB, Plotly). This gives AI-level adaptability with deterministic, reliable data processing.

```

---

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `core/config.py`:

```python
# LLM — reads from .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
ANTHROPIC_MODEL   = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_MODEL", "claude-sonnet-4-5")
LLM_MAX_TOKENS    = int(os.getenv("LLM_MAX_TOKENS", "4096"))

# Data directories
BASE_DIR      = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data"
BRONZE_DIR    = BASE_DIR / "bronze"
SILVER_DIR    = BASE_DIR / "silver"
GOLD_DIR      = BASE_DIR / "gold"
STTM_DIR      = BASE_DIR / "sttm"
PROFILES_DIR  = BASE_DIR / "profiles"
REPORTS_DIR   = BASE_DIR / "reports"
```

---

## Observability

Every agent invocation writes a full trace to `data/traces/`.

### Trace file location

```
data/traces/trace_{agent_name}_{run_id[:8]}.json
```

### What each trace contains

```json
{
  "agent": "bronze_agent",
  "run_id": "abc12345-def6-7890-...",
  "started_at": "2025-05-17T10:30:00Z",
  "input": {
    "input_files": ["data/sales.csv"],
    "sttm_path": "data/sttm/sttm_bronze_abc12345.csv"
  },
  "plan": "I will first inspect the CSV files to understand their schema, then apply the STTM rules...",
  "tool_calls": [
    { "tool": "inspect_task_tool", "args": {} },
    { "tool": "bronze_ingestion_tool", "args": {} }
  ],
  "reasoning_steps": [
    { "role": "task_input", "content": "Ingest the raw CSV files..." },
    { "role": "ai_reasoning", "content": "I can see 3 columns..." },
    { "role": "tool_result", "tool": "inspect_task_tool", "content": "..." }
  ],
  "output": {
    "output_paths": ["data/bronze/sales_bronze.parquet"]
  },
  "duration_seconds": 4.2,
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Audit logs

`core/audit.py` logs every phase start/complete/fail event including file paths produced, decisions made, and error details. These are readable JSON files useful for debugging failed runs.

---

## Agent Handoffs

The `run_id` and `business_intent` travel through the entire pipeline. Every file produced (profile, STTMs, Parquets, report, traces) includes `run_id` in its filename — tying a complete run together for debugging.

| Handoff | From | To | Via | What travels |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-------------|
| H0 | User | Orchestrator | Function call | CSV paths + business_intent |
| H1 | Orchestrator | Profiler | Tool call | CSV paths + run_id + goal |
| H2 | Profiler | STTM (Bronze) | Scratchpad | profile.json path |
| H3 | STTM | Bronze Agent | PipelineState | sttm_bronze.csv path *(after human approval)* |
| H4 | Bronze | STTM (Silver) | Scratchpad | Bronze Parquet paths |
| H5 | STTM | Silver Agent | PipelineState | sttm_silver.csv path *(after human approval)* |
| H6 | Silver | STTM (Gold) | Scratchpad | Silver Parquet paths |
| H7 | STTM | Gold Agent | PipelineState | sttm_gold.csv path *(after human approval)* |
| H8 | Gold | Reporter | Scratchpad | Gold Parquet paths |
| H9 | Reporter | Streamlit UI | PipelineState | report.html path |

## FAQ

**Q: Why are there 4 phases instead of running everything at once?**

The STTM is the transformation recipe. If it is wrong, all downstream data is wrong. Phases create human review checkpoints before each layer executes — preventing errors from propagating silently through the pipeline.

**Q: Why does every agent have an inspect tool AND an execution tool?**

The inspect tool is lightweight — it reads metadata without transforming any data. This lets the agent understand what it is working with and form a plan before committing to execution. It is the difference between a scripted agent and an autonomous one.

**Q: What is the scratchpad? Is it a special library?**

No — it is a plain Python dictionary (`{}`). Both tools in a phase are created inside the same factory function, so they share the same dict via Python closure. Tool 1 writes a path, Tool 2 reads it. No library needed.

**Q: Why use closures instead of passing file paths as tool arguments?**

LLMs are unreliable at reproducing exact file system paths and UUIDs — they paraphrase and truncate. Closures capture the real values at tool creation time. The LLM just calls the tool; it never needs to know or reproduce the paths.

**Q: Can I swap the LLM model?**

Yes. Set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` in your `.env` file to any Claude model (e.g. `claude-opus-4-5`). The `_make_llm()` factory in each agent reads this setting.

**Q: What happens if a phase fails partway through?**

All outputs up to that point are saved to disk and in `PipelineState`. You can call the failed phase function again with the saved state — the pipeline resumes from that phase without reprocessing earlier phases.

**Q: Where do I find the generated STTM to review before approving?**

In `data/sttm/`. The Streamlit UI also renders the STTM as a table directly in the browser at the approval gate. You can edit the CSV file before approving if you want to modify any rules.
